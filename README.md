## Supported shells
**[Xonsh shell](https://github.com/xxh/xxh-shell-xonsh-appimage)** ‚Äî used by default.

**[Zsh shell](https://github.com/xxh/xxh-shell-zsh)** ‚Äî beta version with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/xxh/xxh-plugin-zsh-ohmyzsh) and [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/xxh/xxh-plugin-zsh-powerlevel10k) xxh-plugins. Help wanted for testing and improving entrypoint.

**[Fish shell](https://github.com/xxh/xxh-shell-fish-appimage)** ‚Äî alpha version. Help wanted for testing and improving entrypoint.

**Bash shell** ‚Äî this shell is almost everywhere. Probably the portable version is not needed. You can just create your entrypoint with your lovely functions.

üîé [Search xxh shell on Github](https://github.com/search?q=xxh-shell&type=Repositories) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/repo/all?name=xxh-shell).

 üí°  [Create your shell entrypoint](https://github.com/xxh/xxh-shell-sample) to use another portable shell. 

## Plugins

**xxh plugin** is the set of scripts which will be run on the host when you go using xxh. It could be shell settings, environment variables, plugins, color themes and everything you need. You can find the links to plugins on [xxh-shells repos](https://github.com/search?q=xxh%2Fxxh-shell&type=Repositories). Feel free to fork it.

## Notes

### What about speed?

The first connection takes time for downloading and uploading portable shell. It depends on portable shell size and channel speed. But when xxh is installed on the host and you do just `xxh myhost` then it works as ordinary ssh connection speed.

### How it works?

When you run `xxh myhost` command xxh download portable shell and store locally to future use. Then if it needed xxh upload the portable shell, init scripts and plugins to the host. Finally xxh make ssh connection to the host and run portable shell without any system installs and affection on the target host.

## Development
üõ†Ô∏è In the [xxh-dev](https://github.com/xxh/xxh-dev) repo there is full [docker](https://www.docker.com/)ised environment for development, testing and contribution. The process of testing and development is orchestrated by `xde` tool and as easy as possible.
