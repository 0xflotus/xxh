usage: xxh [ssh arguments] [user@]host[:port] [xxh arguments]

usage: xxh [-h] [-V] [-p SSH_PORT] [-l SSH_LOGIN] [-i SSH_PRIVATE_KEY] [-o SSH_OPTION -o ...]

## Plugins

**xxh plugin** is the set of xsh scripts which will be run when you'll use xxh. You can create xxh plugin with your lovely aliases, tools or color theme and xxh will bring them to your ssh sessions.

## Notes

### Using pip and python

The xxh xonsh will use pip and python from `xonsh.AppImage` by default. You can install pip packages ordinally with `pip install`. They will appear in `$XXH_HOME/pip`.

### How it works?

When you run `xxh <host>` command:

1. If it needed xxh will download portable xonsh shell and store locally to future use. 

2. If it needed xxh upload the portable xonsh to the host (`~/.xxh` by default) along with init scripts and plugins.

3. Finally xxh will makes ssh connection to the server and run portable xonsh shell without any addition installatio and affection on the target host.

## Development
Use [xxh-tests](https://github.com/xonssh/xxh-tests) environment for development and contribution.

### Known Issues

#### GLIBs versions

Current method to make xonsh portable is using an [AppImage](https://appimage.org/) which was built on [manylinux2010 (PEP 571)](https://github.com/niess/linuxdeploy-plugin-python/issues/12). In case you see the error like ``/xonsh-x86_64.AppImage: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version GLIBC_2.25 not found (required by /ppp/xonsh-x86_64.AppImage)`` this means you should rebuild the AppImage for older version of linux distributive. Try [linuxdeploy-plugin-python](https://github.com/niess/linuxdeploy-plugin-python/).

#### WSL1: ^Z

```
# xxh YT-1300
^Z
Unknown answer from server when checking direcotry /home/hansolo/.xxh:
```
This issue was addressed to Xonsh team in [3367](https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh/issues/3367). Just try to run command again.

WSL2 is not tested yet.

#### Related issues
