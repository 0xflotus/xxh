## Plugins

**xxh plugin** is the set of xsh scripts which will be run when you'll use xxh. You can create xxh plugin with your lovely aliases, tools or color theme and xxh will bring them to your ssh sessions.

üîé [Search xxh plugins on Github](https://github.com/search?q=xxh-plugin&type=Repositories)

üí° [Create xxh plugin](https://github.com/xonssh/xxh-plugin-sample)

üìå Pinned plugins:

* [Pipe Liner](https://github.com/xonssh/xxh-plugin-pipe-liner) ‚Äî processing the lines easy with python and classic shell pipes
* [Bar Theme](https://github.com/xonssh/xxh-plugin-theme-bar) ‚Äî theme to stay focused
* [Autojump](https://github.com/xonssh/xxh-plugin-autojump) ‚Äî save time on moving thru directories

## Notes

### Using pip and python

The xxh xonsh will use pip and python from `xonsh.AppImage` by default. You can update pip and install packages ordinally: 
```
$ pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip install --upgrade pandas
```
The packages will appear in `~/.xxh/pip` by default.

### Install [xontribs](https://xon.sh/xontribs.html)

To install [xontribs](https://xon.sh/xontribs.html) in xxh session use `xontrib-install`:
```
xontrib-install xontrib-autojump
xontrib load autojump
```
Don't use `pip` or `xpip` to install xontribs! ([details](https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh/issues/3463))

### How it works?

When you run `xxh <host>` command:

1. If it needed xxh will download portable xonsh shell and store locally to future use. 

2. If it needed xxh will upload the portable xonsh, init scripts and plugins to the host.

3. Finally xxh will make ssh connection to the server and run portable xonsh shell without any system installs and affection on the target host.

## Development
üõ†Ô∏è Use [xxh-dev](https://github.com/xonssh/xxh-dev) environment for development, testing and contribution.
