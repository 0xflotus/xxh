## Install or update
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade xonssh-xxh
```
After install you can just using `xxh` command as replace `ssh` to connecting to the host because `xxh` has seamless support of basic `ssh` command arguments. 

## Usage
```
$ ./xxh -h
usage: xxh <host from ~/.ssh/config>

usage: xxh [ssh arguments] [user@]host[:port] [xxh arguments]

usage: xxh [-h] [-V] [-p SSH_PORT] [-l SSH_LOGIN] [-i SSH_PRIVATE_KEY] [-o SSH_OPTION -o ...] 
           [user@]host[:port]
           [+i] [+if] [+P PASSWORD] [+PP] 
           [+lxh LOCAL_XXH_HOME] [+hxh HOST_XXH_HOME] [+he HOST_EXECUTE_FILE] 
           [+m METHOD] [+v] [+vv]

The xxh is for using the xonsh shell wherever you go through the ssh.

## Supported shells

Currently supported Python-powered [xonsh shell](https://xon.sh).

Experimental: to use another shell you can create your `xxh-shell` entrypoint like in [xxh-shell-xonsh-appimage](https://github.com/xxh/xxh-shell-xonsh-appimage) and add `+s` argument to your `xxh` command. 

## Plugins

**xxh plugin** is the set of xsh scripts which will be run when you'll use xxh. You can create xxh plugin with your lovely aliases, tools or color theme and xxh will bring them to your ssh sessions.

üîé [Search xxh plugins on Github](https://github.com/search?q=xxh-plugin&type=Repositories) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/repo/all?name=xxh-plugin) or üí° [Create xxh plugin](https://github.com/xxh/xxh-plugin-xonsh-sample)

## Notes

### Using python, pip and [xontribs](https://xon.sh/xontribs.html)

The xxh is using pip and python from `xonsh.AppImage` by default. You can update pip (`pip install --upgrade pip`) and install packages ordinally: `pip install --upgrade pandas`. The packages will appear in host xxh home `~/.xxh/pip` by default.

To install [xontribs](https://xon.sh/xontribs.html) in xxh session use `xpip install <package>`. Never use `pip` to install xontribs ([details](https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh/issues/3463)).

### How it works?

When you run `xxh myhost` command xxh download portable xonsh and store locally to future use. Then if it needed xxh upload the portable xonsh, init scripts and plugins to the host. Finally xxh make ssh connection to the host and run portable xonsh shell without any system installs and affection on the target host.

## Development
üõ†Ô∏è In the [xxh-dev](https://github.com/xxh/xxh-dev) repo there is full [docker](https://www.docker.com/)ised environment for development, testing and contribution. The process of testing and development is orchestrated by `xde` tool and as easy as possible.
